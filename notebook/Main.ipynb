Every one please join me in welcoming doctor norman sharp. . Thank you bruce for that kind introduction and thanks for your terrific leadership at ascow aat this important juncture in cancer a search. And thank you tall of you the american ecited plncochology an your forty five thousand members your commitment to cancer search and and care has led a meaningful progress for our patients. A few weeks ago i appeared before the senate appropriations committee the sub committe that funds the nich. Chair of that sub committee sented a roy blunt of the great state of missouri asked me about the future of cancer re search. I explain that this is a time of great hope and optimism. Wehave seen real fair peter progress with kinda centhibeters and imunotheripi precisian medicine all the things that bruce just described and asko tis community has been a huge part of these advances. As i told silior blunt that day and the day that the abstra abstracts are finally released on line well to me that is like christmas morning. I have to confess. I originally joined society american society of plinconcology in nineteen ninety eight. In response to one of the most primal of human emotions abject fear. Yn me exclaim. Back then i was an acollagy fellow at the dena farber partner's cancer care. I was barely done with residency. And i was called upon to provide care for some sick and at times quite desperate patience. In some cases these people had made these ruling trips to boston travelling hours to see what they assumed to be a cutting edge specialist at harvard and often the first doctor they ented up seeing was mi. A as a new doctor. I do not feel up to that task. I suffered from that imposter cyndro. That minnie if not all young doctors feel. Medical residency had not prepared me for this and i felt afraid. Iwas afraid of making mistake. Afraid of missing something important and afraidg of letting these people down. So i joined asco probably for the same reason as many of you. From desire to become better educated about cancer so i could take better care of my patience. Then as now asco provided educational materials for ocollogists and the most important of which to me was the journal of clenical acolleg. As an ecologdist acologist and training i felt that if i read every issue of the jasio as it came out. I would be sufficiently knowledge afble what canser to be able to help these patients. Yhve remember this was back in that pre innernet era when we used to carry around the zeroc's copies of articles and the coats of our white the pockets of our white coats and we employed these articles as a totem. That we used to ward off our clenical in securities. So we were battling cancer that time i felt like the jasio was profisioning my armor. In particular i remember actually carrying around a raggedy eared copy of a nineteen nineties arc scarean article from the jacio that i would quickly scan before seeing any new patient with lonk answer. I recall learning how to use tomoxopun to treat e r positive restcancer from hei mus also through his writings in the jasio many years before i actually met doctor muss. The reading the jasio would help me and my peers march into the examroom of a new patient suffering from a cancer that we had not treated before. And in those rooms. Waited for us some real challenges  i can still see the faces of some of these patients the mother of four with medasatic brest answer. Incarcerated young gay with sarkoma who would leave prison once a week so i could give him his kimoth eri. The guy with a medestatic islet sell tumor whose main symptom was that he kept passing out at work from the extreme hypoglycenia. Young ah i vy positive artists. Whose limfoma we were able to cure h. But his outcome was still terrible because of his failing immunity. These patients were suffering and they wanted help. And they needed a really really good uncologist someone who is educated and thoughtful. So i joined asco in nineteen ninety eight so that i could become va. A really good uncologist whose education and large art developed in fact from reading the gesio. Besides the journal of plinicacology another of asco's most important tools is happening right here now this smeeti. Which is one of the most important events for cancer doctors for patients and other caregivers around the world. Iam happy to share the news as you may have seen in last week's annual report to the nation on the status of cancer. That we continue to see a steady decline in cancer mortality. In nineteen ninety one the cansiortality rate was two hundred and fifteen deaths per hundred thousand person people in the united states in twenty fifteen that number was down to an hundred and fifty nine. I have every reason to believe that that number is even lower to day and will continue to cline in years to come. This represents decreases in canser death for men for women. For children. And for individuals of all major efinit groups. More good news is the very strong and by partisan's support we've been receiving from congress for cancer search. For the fourth year to row. We have seen budget increases for the insia and the ena. Fyscal year twenty eighteen omnibas spinning bill past last march provides a two hundred seventy five million dollar increase to the insi budget as well as continued full funding for the cantermoon shot. So with new discoveries successful treatment approaches continued research progress and additional funding. As a community i believe we on collogists can feel a lot of optimism the potencial vo break throughs has never i believe been greater than it is now. So that's good news and it is it's good news but no doubt we still face significant challenges and i think these are well known to this audience there has been little progress in certain types of cancer pecariatigadno parsonoma lioblastoma. There are still too many child children dying of cancerty united states. We have to admit that it is not sufficient to make progress in just the common cancers or the best understood cancers ar the cancers that we find easiest to treat. The national cancers tute is charged with making progress in all types of gancer to the benefit of all patience. Furthermore even when we can cure these kids and adults of cancer too often this comes with a cost of significant and lifelong toxicities from the cure. And one side offect of curate if there be whose true consequences we are just starting to fully appreciate his financial toxesity which clearly can be devastating for cancer survivor. I would argue these areas hof continued slow progress in turn reflect an incomplete understanding of cancerbiology and challenges that exist in the way we do cancer search. And i think it's insii's job to take these challenges head on. When i started in this new roll last october i decided to take six months to go on a listening and learning tour during which time i spoke to patience to advocates clinisions scientists about what the nse i does well and what the inse i could do better. That effort helped me identify four key focus arias on which i wanted to pay special attention as leader of the national cancer institute. These are not new areas ovinsiai however there air is where i think the scale the reach and scope of the insiai plays an especially important catalic roll. Wherein se eyes resources and convenient power and leadership can really propel progress. These are basic science. Modern wort force harnessing bigdeta and. Clinical trials. You can read about each of these areas on my block and cancerdite gove i writ extensively on the topics but i will share some of the highlights of these that i think will be of greatest interest to this audience. I don't think the basic science work of cancer is done. The insyi continues to strongly support investigator driven basic research and always will while on the director of insia. We have a much better understanding of humor cancer now than at any time in human history but we must also admit that we need to do more fundamental research in these areas and i believe at a top down approach is not the way to go here i think focus really has to be on investigator initiated discovery. Inseai has some reults withinify topics for specific focus but once we've done that we really have to sit back and let the proverbial research magic happen. One of the best ways to support investigator initiated science is through the funding of the research project grants with he so called arpigipool. This pull funs the vast majority of investigator initiated oards the arawans the piawans the grants they'r familiar to this group. Toward that end this year i have dedicated an admission an additional hundred and twenty seven million dollars to investigate our initiated science. This is the largest increase to the arpagy pool since two thousand an three. And his possible thanks to significant increases in our congressially appropriated budget over the past few years. . Thank you while this is not solely for basic science there's laudable clinical trials great hell services ere searched many other things funded by the arbigi pool this is the most straightforward way to assure we continue to fund investigator initiated basic science. Discoveries in basic science i believe are what really propelled progress for patience. One of the most important jobs of the national canctitute maybe the most important job at the insy a is to insure a talentant and innovative research work force for the decades ahead. We must continue to press for a diverse work force with regard to background interest air is efnicity enginder. And wis broaden our notion of who we consider our colleagues who we think of his canceror searchers for example. I predict we will be working much more closely in the future with an increasing diversity of experts emunobiologists computer engineers healthgaryconomists jeriatricians. Datad scientists and commutioncologists. We are doing many things in this areatean se i but one in particular is it titted to address the plight of the early stage investigator or in fedspeak the e s i. Again thanks to the support of congress this year the insii is able to set aside dedicated funding for yes es to increase their chances of getting a first major grant like an aro one from the insii. This extra funding will increase the number of first arawons to early stage investigators by at least twenty five per cent and twenty eighteen. The insay i will also be looking at many strategies to encourage development of the right's skill sets for the future o cancer search through dedicated funding of training grants and professional development opportunities. Bicdata is another area where we've seen a transformation that creates great opportunities for cancer search ing care. But it also creates some new challenges. Embracing the potential of bigdato will add speed and dimension across our work within the cancer enterprise. If you consider that were the ninety per cent of all diginal data grated date across all fields was produced in the last two years. Then you begin to get some sense of the proble. You hear a lot about data sharing and that is important but i believe we must move beyond just passive data sharing and on to intentional data aggregation. In order to fully levers the power of data. Establishing linkages and intropability of diverse complex data sets to understand cancer care and to provide real world evidence. For example. Linking gunomac data with pythology data with radiology data with political data that's been mined from an electronic health record using machine learning. In a large large number of patients all the while while a sheering data privacy and security. The power of that sort of rasource will be incredibl. This will benefit the entire cancer or search community including researchers here to day. I think there thear kinds of questions in cancer research that are almost intractable by any traditional means that can be addressed by such large anitated multimotal detacets. So how are we ging to do this how are we ging to harness be data. Well first this is a place where we need to pay attention to the work forse attracting young data scientists and decancer sir. We will also focus on the lingage of many lorge dedosets maintained by the insiai to provide interopability. There are several interesting efforts to talk about inhessaria for example we're going to elinc the enormous data set of the cantergeno matlis where possible to the clonical data for these patients. The insiai's seer programme is one of the very biggest of the isiai big data initiatives and is taking some innovative steps worth noting. The insy i supported surveillance epidenealogy and inresults programme or seer. Was created by federal law in nineteen seventy one as part of the national cancer act. It is collected statistics on cancerdeaths and outcomes for forty five years to support research on the diagnosis and treatment of kance. It consists of sixteen population based registries covering thirty three per cent of the united states population. These registries collect information on all cancer cases for residence of the state or region. And they represent racial and ethic minorities and various geographic subburbs. Seer is one of the most important things the insee i does to support population sciences research. The sere contracts were just recompeted and we are now actively exploring approaches to innovatably augment this rich data sets capabilities through many novel sorts of data linkages. Beyond seer we are also working on date inititives with federal partners like the department of energy which gives the insiai access to exa scale computing is cutting edge high performance computin. Were working with the ftien with s mes which had interesting large nanisets of potintial value to cancer searches. These data efforts are supported by a developing in siai cancer data egosystem. Which is being significantly amplified with targeted funding from the cancer moonsha. This includes highly successful cloud resources that are now widely used for storage and computing as well as robust efforts for the insiita set standards for data sharing and for interoperability. I believe we have to do these things because the costs of not harnessing bigdata are too great by doing these things i believe we can learn from every patient. Every one of to day's standard of certherapes is available because of a past successful clinical trial. But translating to day's discoveries into routine effective treatments is it a matter i believe of doing just more of the same. There are several problems that we have to honestly face. Decreased the cruel. And poor cruel of unrepresented populations. Increasing perpatient costs and then to the delays the spiraling times to open a trial and the spiralling times to the completion of a clinical trial. These problems are really bad for cance for clinical researchers and theyre even worse for patience. As a major funder of clinical trials the insyi can improve these problems here are some things the insy i can do to help. We have to get rid of a necessary exclusion criteria and confusing concentforms we are encouraging and expanding the use of central iarbes. Weny trials with innovative adapted designs to identify inactive agents quickly. And thereby prioritized wood drugs for further testin. And when he trials that are really based on a modern understanding of cancs. The fact that cancer's tremendous heterogeneity means that traditional clincal trials models are becoming less useful. Largely gone are the days when the cardiology paradime rot reigned in clinical trials when we enrolled enormous numbers of patients on large facedry trials with slightly different treatment protocols where very modest improvements upon a largely and effective regiment was considered as success. One approach about which i am personally excited is demonstrated by the insii match trial. In sei's match trial i believe as an example of inovative trial design this precision on cology trial allicated patients to one of about thirty arms a faribe based on symatic genetic testing of their tumors. Some of the first efficacy data from match or being presented here at this meeting so i won't steal any one's thunder by going in to tail but i like to highlake the importance of this trial as an example of the new architecture of new ways to conduct clinical research. This smap shows what to me is one of the most important facts about match cordinated with ecog acron matches and rolled more than six thousand patients to cutting edge tharapeutic trials at eleven hundred sights across the count. This has been the fastest accruing trial in the history of the national cancer institute. This shows that this this shows to us that even a highly complex precision medicine trial can be conducted in the ethnically diverse communities where the real world patients live. And it also shows that if we have well designed efforts like match the patience will come. Whor employing a similar approach napo to the pediatric match trial working with the children's oncollogy group inseaias brought pedeatric match to two hundred sites across the country with eight arms currently en rolling. These efforts are important and i believe will become even more so as more and more drew out drugs are approved based on drive r mutation rather than on tissue of origin. Mark my words trows like match and pedsmatch are already changing how we make progress on a colle. Lastly while novel trial designs like that of match are generating excitement large traditionally structure trials to define standard iss kaic standards of care remain critical for progress in cancersearch and the insyai will continue its robust support for these efforts as well. For example act as meeting results from the tailorax trial will be reported. This political trial in sixty seven hundred women supported by the insia a took women with breastcancer and examined the aint the the use of anty hormonol for secitatoxic therapy for ear positive disease a with tale with theraby tailor based on an arnay based genetic riskscore. The results of this trial will have implications for thousands of women with bresk answer over the next few years. The insa insiized major efforts with regard to large clinical trials are mostly supported through our clinical trial's networks like the national clinical trial's network or the n c t n. One of the major challenges for these networks over the past few years however has been a rapid increase in the per patient costs for patience on these trials. The insyi appreciates the problems that these sky rocketing costs have caused for incitian trials and today i'm announcing that ere gong to help. This year we will be providing an additional ten million dollars to support trials run within the encitiand an incor. The majority of this funding. Will be used to augment per patient reimbersement rates at a hundred hundred and eighty sites that treat adult and pediatric cancers. . So i'm sure we'll hear about rapid progress at this meaning what were you doing together be shaping the future of cancer search in changing lives. But before i conclude as we dive in everything tatis asco the posters the sessions the net working i'd like to talk about something that's bit on my mind for a while. An almost overarching worry of the cancer doctor to day has become the management of expectations we don'tra overpromise and give hope that's false to patience we don't wat to provide false hope. But my friend i am worried my friends i am worried we have been losing the points. I think we become scared to tell our patience that we actually hope to cure them. And it may be time to re examine how we communicate our efforts in this area. As an auncologisti used to cringe at the notion of curing cancer when talking to a patient what what if i told them that they were cured but then the cancer actually came back. Ar devastting that. I especially know why the notion of cure makes some it some so many of us so uncomfortab. Curing cancer that is making it go away and never come back. Really hard. Much harder than initially conceived and the word cure should not be thrown around lightly particularly not with vulnerable patience present. But it also worth making two points first. We are curing patiencs now more than ever even some people with really bad cancers at very advanced stages i personally never thought i'd see some of the result results that it were now seeing in medestatical uncancer melono. Secondd. Even if the idea of curing cancer makes us uncomfortable it is what our patience and our funders expect. They don't just want extended progression for survival or enhanced quality of life or reduce costs or whatever surgot marker we may pick they expect us to deliv. This was the subtext behind the question the senator asked me recently when i test. Our patients and their representatives want to know that we are making progress to prevent and to cure this set of formidable diseases. After being a member of asco for twenty years i'm happy to say that those early fears of walking into a patient's room and having absolutely no options wile those days are going away if they are not gone already. Almost every day we learn of new discoveries advances and approaches that show tremendous promise now we have options. We hare treatments. And sometimes we even have a cure. Thank you\""

other caregivers around the world i am happy to share the news as you may haveseen is last week’s annual report to the nation on the status of cancer that we continueto see a steady decline in cancer mortality in 1991 the cancer mortality rate was 215deaths per 100000 people in the us in 2015 that number was down to 159 there is reason to believe that the numberis even lower now and will continue to decline this represents decreases in cancer deathfor men women and children and for all major ethnic groups more good news is the strong bipartisansupport we’re receiving from congress for the fourth year in a row we have seenbudget increases for the nih and the nci the fiscal year 2018 omnibus spending billpassed in march provides a $275 million dollar increase to the nci budget as well as continuedfull funding for the cancer moonshot so with new discoveries successful treatmentapproaches continued research progress and additional funding as a community oncologistscan feel a lot of optimism the potential for breakthroughs has never been greater thanit is right now so that’s the good news and its good newsbut no doubt we still face significant challenges these are well known to this audience littleprogress in certain cancer types such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma there are still too many children dying ofcancer we have to admit that it is not sufficientto make progress in just the common cancers or the best understood cancers or the easiestto treat cancers the nci is charged with making progress inall types of cancer to benefit all patients and even when we can cure kids and adultsof cancer too often this comes with the cost of significant and lifelong toxicities fromthe cure and one side effect of curative therapy whosetrue consequences we are just starting to fully appreciate is financial toxicity whichcan be devastating for cancer survivors and i would argue these areas of continuedslow progress in turn reflect an incomplete understanding of cancer biology and challengesto the ways we do cancer research i think it is nci's job to take these challengesheadon when i started in this new role last octoberi decided to take 6 months to go on a listening and learning tour during which time i spoke to many patientsadvocates clinicians and scientists about what the nci does well and areas that needsimprovement that effort helped me identify four key focusareas on which i wanted to focus as leader of the nci these are not new areas for nci however they are areas where i think thescale and reach of the nci plays an especially important role where nci’s resources and convening powerand leadership can act as a catalyst they are basic science workforce big dataclinical trials you can read more about each of these areason my blog on cancergov but i will share some highlights that i think will be of greatestinterest to ascogoers i don’t think the basic science work ofcancer is done\\xa0 the nci continues to strongly support investigatordrivenbasic research and always will while i am director we have a much better understanding of cancernow than at any time in human history but we must also admit that we need more fundamentalresearch in this area and i believe a topdown approach is notthe way to go here focus has to be on investigatorinitiateddiscovery nci has some role to identify topics for specificfocus… but once we have done that we have to sit back and let the proverbial magic happen one of the best ways to support investigatorinitiatedscience is through the funding of the research project grants (the rpg pool) this pool funds the vast majority of investigatorinitiatedawards the r01’s and the even larger program project grants (eg p01’s) toward that end this year i have dedicatedan additional 127m dollars into investigatorinitiated science this is the largest increase to the rpg poolsince 2003 and is possible thanks to significant increases in our congressionally appropriatedbudget over the past few years while this is not solely for basic science(there are lots of laudable clinical trials and hsr funded from rpg pool) this is themost straightforward way to assure we continue to fund investigatorinitiated basic science discoveries in basic science propel progressfor patients one of our most important jobs at nci perhapsthe most important job of the nci is to ensure a talented and innovative research workforcefor the decades ahead we must continue to press for a diverse workforcewith regard to background interest areas ethnicity and gender we must broaden our notions of who we considerto be our colleagues for example i predict we will be workingmore closely with an increasing diversity of experts immunobiologists computer engineershealthcare economists geriatricians data scientists and yes community oncologists we are doing many things in this area butone in particular is intended to address the plight of the early stage investigator (oresi) again thanks to the support of congressthis year the nci is able to set aside dedicated funding esis to increase their chances ofgetting a first major grant (an r01) from the nci this extra funding will increase the numberof first r01’s to esis by at least 25% nci will also be looking at many strategiesto encourage development of the right skill sets for the future of cancer research throughdedicated funding of training grants and professional development opportunities big data is another area where we’ve seena transformation that creates great opportunities for cancer research and care but also newchallenges embracing the potential of big data will addspeed and dimension to our work across the cancer enterprise if you consider that more than 90% of alldigital data created to date across all fields was produced in the last two years… youget the idea you hear a lot about data sharing and thatis important but we must also move beyond passive data sharing to intentional data aggregationin order to fully leverage the power of data establishing linkages and interoperabilityof diverse complex data sets to understand cancer care and provide real world evidence for example linking genomic data with pathologydata with radiology data with clinical data mined by machine learning from ehrs in a largenumber of patients while assuring data privacy and security the power of that is incredible this will benefit the entire research communityincluding all of you research questions that are almost intractableby traditional means can be addressed by large annotated multimodal datasets so how are we going to harness big data this is a place where we need to pay attentionto the workforce attracting young data scientists into cancer research we will focus on the linkage of many largedatasets maintained by the nci to provide interoperability there are several interesting efforts in thisarea to talk about for example we are going to link the enormousdata set of the cancer genome atlas where possible to the clinical data for those patients the nci’s seer program is one of the biggestof the nci’s big data initiatives and is taking some innovative steps worth noting the ncisupported surveillance epidemiologyand end results (seer) program was created by federal law in 1971 as part of the nationalcancer act it has collected statistics on cancer deathsand outcomes for 45 years to support research on the diagnosis treatment and outcomes ofcancer since 1973 it consists of 16 populationbased registriescovering 33% of the us population these registries collect information on allcancer cases for residents of the state or region they represent racial and ethnic minoritiesand various geographic subgroups seer is one of the most important things thenci does to support population sciences research the seer contracts were just recompeted andwe are actively exploring approaches to innovatively augment this rich dataset’s capabilitiesthrough many sorts of novel data linkages beyond seer we are also working on data initiativeswith federal partners like the department of energy which gives the nci access to cuttingedgeexascale computing as well as working with the fda and cms which have interesting largedatasets of potential value to cancer researchers these data efforts are supported by a developinga nci cancer data ecosystem which is being significantly amplified with new targetedfunding from the cancer moonshot this includes highly successful cloud resourcesfor storage and computing as well as robust efforts for the nci to set standards for datasharing and interoperability we have to do these things because the costsof not harnessing big data are too great by doing this we can learn from every patient every one of today’s standardofcare therapiesis available because of a past successful clinical trial but translating today’s discoveries intoroutine effective treatments isn’t a matter of doing more of the same there are several problems that we have toface decreased accrual and poor accrual of underrepresentedpopulations increasing per patient costs and delaysspiraling times to open and to the completion of clinical trials these problems are bad for clinical researchersand even worse for patients as a major funder of clinical trials ncican improve these problems here are some things the nci can facilitate we have to get rid of unnecessary exclusioncriteria and confusing consent forms we need to encourage and expand the use ofcentral irbs we need trials with innovative adaptive designsto identify inactive agents quickly and thereby prioritize good drugs for further testing and we need trials that are based on a modernunderstanding of cancer the fact of cancer’s tremendous heterogeneitymeans that traditional clinical trials models are becoming less useful largely gone are the days when the cardiologyparadigm of clinical trials reigned when we enrolled enormous numbers of patients intolarge phase iii trials with slightly different treatment protocols where very modest improvementsupon a largely ineffective regimen was considered success one emerging approach about which i am excitedis demonstrated by the nci match trial nci’s match trial is an example of innovativetrial design this precision oncology trial allocated patientsto one of ~30 arms of therapy based on somatic genetic testing some of the first efficacy results from matchare being presented here at asco so i won’t go into detail but i would like to highlightthe importance of this trial as an example of new ways to conduct clinical research this map shows what to me is one of the mostimportant facts of match coordinated with ecogacrin it has enrolled more than 6000patients to cuttingedge therapeutic trials at 1100 sites across the country it has been the fastest accruing trial innci’s history this shows us that even highly complex precisionmedicine trials can be conducted in the ethnically diverse communities where realworld patientslive and if we have welldesigned efforts likematch the patients will come we are also employing this same approach throughthe pediatric match trial working with the children’s oncology groupnci has brought pediatric match to 200 sites across the country with 8 arms currently open these efforts are important and will becomemoreso as more and more drugs are approved based on driver mutation rather than on tissueoforigin mark my words trials like match and pedsmatch are already changing how we make progress in oncology lastly while novel trial designs like thatof match are generating much excitement larger traditionally structured trials to definestandards of care remain critical for progress in cancer research and the nci will continueits robust support for these efforts for example at this meeting results fromthe tailorx trial will be reported this clinical trial in 6700 women with breastcancer has examined the use of antihormonal versus cytotoxic therapy for women with er+breast cancer based on results of an rnabased genetic risk score the results of this trial will have implicationsfor thousands of women with bc over the next few years the nci’s major efforts with regard to largeclinical trials are largely supported through our clinical trials networks like the nationalclinical trials network (or the nctn) one of the major challenges for these networksover the past few years however has been a rapid increase in the per patient costsfor patients on trials the nci appreciates the problems that theseskyrocketing costs have caused for nctn trials and today i am announcing that we are goingto help i am announcing that this year we will beproviding an additional $10m to support trials run within the nctn and ncorp the majority of this funding will be usedto augment per patient reimbursement rates at 180 sites that treat adult or pediatriccancers i’m sure we will hear about rapid progressat this meeting what we are doing together is shaping thefuture of cancer research and changing lives but before i conclude and we dive into allthat is asco the posters the sessions and the networking i’d like to talk aboutsomething that's been on my mind an almost overarching worry of the cancerdoctor today has become the management of expectations\\xa0 we don’t want to overpromiseand give people—especially patients—false hope\\xa0 but my friends i am worried we have beenlosing the point i think we have become scared to tell our patients that we hope to “cure”them and it may be time to reexamine how we communicateour efforts in this area\\xa0 as an oncologist—i used to cringe at thenotion of “curing cancer” when talking to a patient\\xa0 what if i told them they were cured but thenthe cancer actually came back i especially know why the notion of cure makesso many of us uncomfortable curing cancer making it go away and nevercome back is really hard much harder than initially conceived and the word “cure”should not be thrown around lightly with vulnerable patients present but it is also worth making two points first we are curing patients now and morepeople than ever even some people with really bad cancersat very advanced stages i never thought i’d see some of the resultsthat we are now seeing in metastatic lung cancer and melanoma and second even if the idea of curing cancermakes us uncomfortable it is what are patients and our funders expect they don’t just want extended progressionfreesurvival or enhanced quality of life or reduced costs or whatever other surrogate markerwe might pick they expect us to deliver this was the subtext behind senator blunt’squestion to me when i recently testified our patients and their representatives wantto know that we are making progress to prevent and\\xa0to cure\\xa0this set of formidable diseases after being a member of asco for 20 yearsi’m happy to say that those early fears of walking into a new patient’s room andhaving absolutely no options…are going away if not already gone almost every day we learn of new discoveriesadvances and approaches that show promise we have options we have treatments and sometimes we now do have a cure thank you \""
